## Szenario:
Imagine an external event booking system exports a simple plain json export file of the newest bookings.
This data should be presented in our system.

## What you need to do?:

- Please note that over time, large amounts of data will accumulate
- Read the json data and save it to the database using php
- Create a simple page with filters for the employee name, event name and date
- Output the filtered results in a table below the filters
- Add a last row for the total price of all filtered entries

## Environment:
